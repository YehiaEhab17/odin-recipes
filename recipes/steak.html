    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons green curry paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut milk</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 pounds flap steak, trimmed of fat</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk curry paste, fish sauce, rice vinegar, coconut milk, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a large shallow glass or ceramic bowl. Add the flap steak and turn to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the flap meat from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Cook flap steak on the preheated grill until it starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer meat to a plate to rest for at least five minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
